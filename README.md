Steps for me,
1. Make sure GET responses work and the data can be shown on the page DONE
2. Make it look nice done (could still use more work but not sure what to add)
3. Make it so I can pull more than 70 github request per hour via the token. DONE 
4. Host it (prob Amazon firebase)



# Gonna change the readme after hosting it via firebase

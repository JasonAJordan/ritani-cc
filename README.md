# Ritani's Code Challenge Jason Jordan

Hosted via Firebase here https://ritanicc.web.app/ 
Made with a React.js


### Functionality

Users can look up github username and show the github user's handle, follower count, and follower images.
Loads 15 follower images at a time, there also is a load more button which let's the user look through the github user's followers.
Styling was loosely based after Ritani's website design. 


### Others/Misc 

My github API token is on the gitignore file, if you want to run this app on your machine you must make your own github API token and create the files which stores that token. 

For me I made a file called keys.js which stored the api Key which get's called upon via "import Key from "./keys";" however keys.js is in my gitignore file.
